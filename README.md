Couldn't find a config.json file at '/Users/bertinjacobs/.homebridge/config.json'. Look at config-sample.json for examples of how to format your config.js and add your home accessories.  

#Configuration

The plugin has the ability to ignore certain device ID's. Just add these ID's as shown in the sample-config.json file.

#Supported Devices
The following devices have been tested:

* VeraLite UI7 (Although it shoud work on Vera3 and VeraEdge)

* Fibaro RGBW (Yes! It has a colour wheel) (Removed for now)

#Known Issues
The Aeon sensor seems to be only partially supported. This could be due to functionality issues on the front-end apps.
